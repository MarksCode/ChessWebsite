# Let's Play Chess!

by Ron Marks

A website I built allowing two people to play chess.

To see it in action (on one machine): http://people.ucsc.edu/~romarks/

Directions:

Run locally using node, then go to localhost:9000. 
Hit join on each player's machine.
Click piece then destination to make a move.
